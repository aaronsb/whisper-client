## Contributing to Documentation

When adding new documentation:

1. Create a new markdown file in this directory
2. Link to it from this README.md
3. If appropriate, also add a reference in the main project README.md

## Transcription Files

Transcription output files (markdown files generated from audio transcriptions) should NOT be committed to the repository. The `.gitignore` file is configured to ignore all `.md` files except those in this `docs/` directory and the root README.md and LICENSE.md.

If you need to save transcription results, please save them outside of this repository or add them to this directory only if they serve as documentation examples.
